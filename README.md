# Logistic-Regression
Logistic regression is basically a supervised classification algorithm. In a classification problem, the target variable(or output), y, can take only discrete values for given set of features(or inputs), X.

Contrary to popular belief, logistic regression IS a regression model. The model builds a regression model to predict the probability that a given data entry belongs to the category numbered as “1”. Just like Linear regression assumes that the data follows a linear function, Logistic regression models the data using the sigmoid function.
